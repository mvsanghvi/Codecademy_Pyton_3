# 1. Our school is expanding! We are welcoming a new set of students today from all over the world.
# Using the provided table, create a two-dimensional list called incoming_class to represent the data. 
# Each sublist in incoming_class should contain the name, nationality, and grade for a single student.
incoming_class = [["Kenny", "American", 9], ["Tanya", "Ukrainian", 9], ["Madison", "Indian", 7]]
print(incoming_class)

# 2. "Madison" passed an exam to advance a grade. She will be pushed into 8th grade rather than her current 7th in our list.
# Modify the list using double brackets [][] to make the change. Use positive indices. Print incoming_class to see our change.
incoming_class[2][2]= 8
print(incoming_class)

# 3. "Kenny" likes to be called by his nickname "Ken". 
# Modify the list using double brackets [][] to accommodate the change but only using negative indices.
# Print incoming_class to see our change.
