# 1. Maria is entering customer data for her web store business. We’re going to help her organize her data.
# Start by turning this list of customer first names into a list called first_names. 
# Make sure to enter the names in this order:

#     Ainsley
#     Ben
#     Chani
#     Depak

# 2. Maria wants to track all customer’s preferred sizes for her clothing. Create a list called preferred_size.
# Fill our new list preferred_size with the following data, containing the preferred sizes for Ainsley, Ben, and Chani:
first_names = ["Ainsley", "Ben", "Chani", "Depak"]
preferred_size = ["Small", "Large", "Medium"]

# 3. Oh no! We forgot to add Depak’s size. Depak’s size is "Medium". Use .append() to add "Medium" to the preferred_size list.
# Print preferred_size to see our change.
preferred_size.append("Medium")
print(preferred_size)

# 4. Maria is having a hard time visualizing which customer is associated with each size. 
# Let’s restructure our two lists into a two-dimensional list to help Maria.
# In addition to our already available data, Maria is adding a third value for each customer that reflects if they want expedited shipping on their orders.
# This will be reflected using a boolean value (True for expedited, False for regular)
# Create a two-dimensional list called customer_data using the following table as a reference for the data. 
# Each sublist should contain a name, size, and expedited shipping option for a single person. Print customer_data to see the data.
customer_data = [["Ainsley", "Small", True], ["Ben", "Large", False], ["Chani",	"Medium",	True], ["Depak", "Medium",	False]]
print(customer_data)

# 5. "Chani" reached out to Maria. She requested to switch to regular shipping to save some money.
# Change the data value for "Chani"‘s shipping preference to False in our two-dimensional list to reflect the change.
customer_data[2][-1]= False

# 6. "Ben" reached out to Maria asking to remove his shipping option (the True or False value) because he is unsure what type he wants.
# Use the .remove() method to delete the shipping value from the sublist that contains Ben’s data.
# Note: We never explicitly went over how to use the .remove() method on a 2d list together. 
# If you feel like you are struggling, look at the hint for guidance.
customer_data[1].remove(False)

# 7. Great job making it this far! 
# One last thing, Maria received new customers, "Amit" and "Karim", the following 2d list contains their data: 
# Create a new variable customer_data_final. 
# Combine our existing list customer_data with our new customer 2d list using + by adding it to the end of customer_data.
# Print customer_data_final to see our final result.

customer_data_final= customer_data+[["Amit", "Large", True], ["Karim", "X-Large", False]]
print(customer_data_final)
